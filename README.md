Move humans into robots. 

## Development
This project uses dev containers for development so all the tools/scrips needed to setup a working environment should be in the `.devcontainer` folder.

Its based on the [Python 3 template](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/main/containers/python-3). 

We use [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) to install tools and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management.
